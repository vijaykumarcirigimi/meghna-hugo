  title: What I Do
  content: |
    If there’s anything that a business needs to grow and thrive, it’s a strong online presence. Many small and medium businesses have found immense success by going digital. A user-friendly website, a clear outline of the company’s services coupled with a good SEO strategy can make a huge difference in both growth and revenue.

    Having been in the digital marketing game for over a decade, I’ve worked with some of the top eCommerce websites in India and have created winning strategies for their growth. I have also engaged with start-ups and developed their entire digital marketing blueprint.

    My strategy as an SEO expert is simple – Analyse, Empathize, Create, and Engage; analyse your needs, empathize, create the services you require, and engage to build a lasting relationship.

    ## I Help Companies Grow
    If you are one of these businesses that do not have a strong online presence and have absolutely no idea how to expand your digital footprint, you need the services of an SEO expert. I use advanced methods to assess your target audience and bring them to you. My strategies are tailored to your needs, goals, resources, and budget to get the most profit out of your services.

    Businesses that need a digital marketing strategy to start expanding and grow can utilize my full- range of SEO services. I will provide end-to-end expert SEO solutions that include website creation, content writing, competitor website analysis up to analytics and reporting.

    - There aren’t many agencies who will offer freelance digital marketing in Bangalore. Most of them provide “packages” with services that you may or may not need. Later, you end up paying more for solutions that you could have used for a fraction of the price. That’s why I do a complete analysis of your website and business before suggesting any service.
