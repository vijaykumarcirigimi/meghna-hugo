  title: What I Do
  content: "If there’s anything that a business needs to grow and thrive, it’s a strong
    online presence. Many small and medium businesses have found immense success by
    going digital. A user-friendly website, a clear outline of the company’s services
    coupled with a good SEO strategy can make a huge difference in both growth and
    revenue.\n\nHaving been in the digital marketing game for over a decade, I’ve
    worked with some of the top eCommerce websites in India and have created winning
    strategies for their growth. I have also engaged with start-ups and developed
    their entire digital marketing blueprint.\n\nMy strategy as an SEO expert is simple
    – Analyse, Empathize, Create, and Engage; analyse your needs, empathize, create
    the services you require, and engage to build a lasting relationship.\n\n## I
    Help Companies Grow\nIf you are one of these businesses that do not have a strong
    online presence and have absolutely no idea how to expand your digital footprint,
    you need the services of an SEO expert. I use advanced methods to assess your
    target audience and bring them to you. My strategies are tailored to your needs,
    goals, resources, and budget to get the most profit out of your services.\n\nBusinesses

    If you are one of these businesses that do not have a strong online presence and
    have absolutely no idea how to expand your digital footprint, you need the services
    of an SEO expert.\n\n- I use advanced methods to assess your target audience and
    bring them to you. My strategies are tailored to your needs, goals, resources,
    and budget to get the most profit out of your services.\n\n- There aren’t many
    agencies who will offer freelance digital marketing in Bangalore. Most of them
    provide “packages” with services that you may or may not need. Later, you end
    up paying more for solutions that you could have used for a fraction of the price.
    That’s why I do a complete analysis of your website and business before suggesting
    any service.\n\n## How does it work\n| Submit the Contact Form | Telephonic Discussion
